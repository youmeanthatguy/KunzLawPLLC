# KunzLawPLLC
This is a website I am currently designing for Kunz Law, PLLC in Durham, NC. This is being done free of charge since the client 
understands I will be learning about code and design as I go and has agreed to not place a deadline on it as a result. It 
incorporates HTML, CSS and some JS.

There is currently no responsive design since the site is being designed and redesigned by myself and my wife as we go. Once 
the entire project is finished, the CSS file will be updated for a tablet and then a mobile device.

Some of the code is a touch sloppy, but it is a learning project.

There has been a delay in updating the current code because after discussing it with the client, we thought it made sense to see if we could build him a web server that he could host out of his office. Most of the research on that project is taking place offline.
